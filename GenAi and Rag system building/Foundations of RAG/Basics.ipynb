    "### **Stemming in RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "Stemming is a text normalization technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that reduces words to their base or root form by removing suffixes. In RAG, stemming helps improve retrieval by matching different word forms to the same root, ensuring better search results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Simple Example:**  \n",
    "- Original words: *\"running\", \"runs\", \"runner\"*  \n",
    "- After stemming: *\"run\", \"run\", \"run\"*  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if a user searches for *\"run\"*, the RAG system can retrieve documents containing any of these variations, improving accuracy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **How It Helps in RAG:**  \n",
    "- Reduces vocabulary size for efficient searching.  \n",
    "- Helps match queries with relevant documents even if word forms differ.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Stemming is less precise than lemmatization (which uses grammar rules), but it’s faster and useful for large-scale retrieval tasks.\n"

    "### **Tokenization in RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Definition:**  \n",
    "Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units called **tokens**, which can be words, subwords, or even characters. In RAG, tokenization helps the system process and understand text efficiently.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why is Tokenization Needed?**  \n",
    "1. **Standardizes Input:** Converts raw text into a structured format for NLP models.  \n",
    "2. **Enables Efficient Processing:** Helps models handle large texts by splitting them into manageable chunks.  \n",
    "3. **Improves Retrieval & Generation:** Ensures accurate matching of queries with documents in RAG.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How Tokenization Works:**  \n",
    "1. **Splitting Text:** A sentence is divided into tokens (words, subwords, or symbols).  \n",
    "2. **Handling Punctuation & Special Cases:** Decides whether to treat punctuation as separate tokens.  \n",
    "3. **Subword Tokenization (Advanced):** Breaks rare words into meaningful sub-parts (e.g., \"unhappiness\" → \"un\", \"happiness\").  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Simple Example:**  \n",
    "**Input Sentence:**  \n",
    "*\"ChatGPT is amazing!\"*  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tokenized Output (Word-Level):**  \n",
    "`[\"ChatGPT\", \"is\", \"amazing\", \"!\"]`  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tokenized Output (Subword-Level, e.g., Byte-Pair Encoding):**  \n",
    "`[\"Chat\", \"G\", \"PT\", \"is\", \"amazing\", \"!\"]`  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How It Helps in RAG:**  \n",
    "- **Better Search:** Ensures queries and documents are broken into comparable units.  \n",
    "- **Handles Unknown Words:** Subword tokenization helps with rare or misspelled words.  \n",
    "- **Compatibility with LLMs:** Most language models (like GPT) require tokenized input.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The choice of tokenizer (word-based, subword-based, or character-based) affects RAG's performance. Modern systems often use **subword tokenizers** (like BPE or WordPiece) for flexibility."
