    "### **Tokenization in RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Definition:**  \n",
    "Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units called **tokens**, which can be words, subwords, or even characters. In RAG, tokenization helps the system process and understand text efficiently.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why is Tokenization Needed?**  \n",
    "1. **Standardizes Input:** Converts raw text into a structured format for NLP models.  \n",
    "2. **Enables Efficient Processing:** Helps models handle large texts by splitting them into manageable chunks.  \n",
    "3. **Improves Retrieval & Generation:** Ensures accurate matching of queries with documents in RAG.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How Tokenization Works:**  \n",
    "1. **Splitting Text:** A sentence is divided into tokens (words, subwords, or symbols).  \n",
    "2. **Handling Punctuation & Special Cases:** Decides whether to treat punctuation as separate tokens.  \n",
    "3. **Subword Tokenization (Advanced):** Breaks rare words into meaningful sub-parts (e.g., \"unhappiness\" â†’ \"un\", \"happiness\").  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Simple Example:**  \n",
    "**Input Sentence:**  \n",
    "*\"ChatGPT is amazing!\"*  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tokenized Output (Word-Level):**  \n",
    "`[\"ChatGPT\", \"is\", \"amazing\", \"!\"]`  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tokenized Output (Subword-Level, e.g., Byte-Pair Encoding):**  \n",
    "`[\"Chat\", \"G\", \"PT\", \"is\", \"amazing\", \"!\"]`  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How It Helps in RAG:**  \n",
    "- **Better Search:** Ensures queries and documents are broken into comparable units.  \n",
    "- **Handles Unknown Words:** Subword tokenization helps with rare or misspelled words.  \n",
    "- **Compatibility with LLMs:** Most language models (like GPT) require tokenized input.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The choice of tokenizer (word-based, subword-based, or character-based) affects RAG's performance. Modern systems often use **subword tokenizers** (like BPE or WordPiece) for flexibility."
